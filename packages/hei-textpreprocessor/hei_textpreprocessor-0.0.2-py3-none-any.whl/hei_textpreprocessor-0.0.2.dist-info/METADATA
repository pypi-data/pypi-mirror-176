# Introduction 
A simple python wrapper for usual text tasks (preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization.)

# Getting Started
Soon, the library can be installed via pip (pip install hei-textpreprocessor)

# Build and Test
The library includes one notebook (demo.ipynb) that demonstrates the use of the library

# Content
The library includes the following classes:
1. Language - holds all information (language-related) that is needed for further text processing.
2. Tokenizer - defines how to text needs to be tokenized
3. Preprocessor - applies standard preprocessing techniques to text.
4. vectorizer - defines how to text needs to be vectorized
