#### EasyLab

Offers simple solutions with GUI. From a folder, it can resize images, change their extensions, applies spatial frequencies, and remove backgrounds...

#### Purpose of the project

+ The purpose of the project is to offer a simple solutions to solve some of the problems that arise when working with big image datasets.
+ The project is a work in progress, and it is not finished yet. Since it offers GUI, it is very practical to use it.

#### Features

+ Resize images
+ Change extension
+ Apply spatial frequencies (low pass, high pass with Butterworth filter)
+ Apply Gaussian blur
+ Apply grayscale filter (RGB to Gray)
+ Rename images (with a desired prefix)
+ Remove background from images (Utilizes deep learning, so it is slow depending on the size of the images)
+ Apply Histogram Equalization
+ Apply CFA (Color Filter Array) filter

#### installation

+ Install easylab with pip:
  ```pip install easylab  ```

#### Usage

it is very simple to use the project.
For the open GUI, use the following command:
```from easylab import easylab```
then open the gui with:
```easylab.easylabgui()```

This basicaly starts the GUI. First, select the input folder then select the output folder. Then just select the options you want to apply to the images. Rename images will change all image names from input folder with input prefix. Don't forget to add extension if you use rename option.

#### Javascript

I will also add some javascript to online version. You can will finished js demos on the easylab website [here]( https://altunenes.github.io/easylab/)

#### E-prime scripts

get the trail list (Image names for the E-Prime) or create a jitter:
