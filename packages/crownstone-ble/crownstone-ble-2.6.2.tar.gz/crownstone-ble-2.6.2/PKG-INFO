Description: # Crownstone BLE library
        
        A library to interact with Crownstones via Bluetooth LE.
        
        This library uses Bleak as bluetooth backend, which supports Windows, MacOS and Linux.
        
        # Installation
        
        Python 3.7 or 3.8 is required for this library. At the moment an upstream dependency (pythonnet) is broken (on Windows 10) for Python 3.9 and newer.
        
        If you want to use python virtual environments, take a look at the [README_VENV](/README_VENV.MD) and be sure that your environment is activated before installing. Afterwards it's as simple as:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install crownstone_ble
        ```
        
        
        # Async functions
        
        This library uses async methods, which **must** be awaited. This is part of Python and uses the asyncio core module to do this.
        If you're unsure about how to use these, there's a million guides and tutorials online. We will assume you know how to use these in the rest of the documentation.
        
        
        
        # CrownstoneBle
        
        ## Initialization
        
        To use Crownstone BLE, you first import it from crownstone_ble.
        
        ```python
        from crownstone_ble import CrownstoneBle
        
        ble = CrownstoneBle()
        ```
        
        CrownstoneBle is composed of a number of top level methods and modules for specific commands. We will first describe these top level methods.
        
        
        ### `__init__(bleAdapterAddress=None)`
        When initializing the CrownstoneBle class, you can provide the bluetooth adapter address to choose which bluetooth adapter to use. This only works on linux. You can get these addresses by running:
        ```
        hcitool dev
        ```
        These addresses are in the "00:32:FA:DE:15:02" format.
        The constructor is not explicitly called with `__init__`, but like this:
        ```python
        ble = CrownstoneBle(bleAdapterAddress="00:32:FA:DE:15:02")
        ```
        On other platforms you can't define which bluetooth adapter to use.
        
        
        ### `async shutDown()`
        Shuts down the library nicely. This is should be done when closing your script.
        
        
        ### `setSettings(adminKey: string, memberKey: string, basicKey: string, serviceDataKey: string, localizationKey: string, meshApplicationKey: string, meshNetworkKey: string)`
        The Crownstone uses encryption by default, so this library needs keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
        These keys are 16 characters long like "adminKeyForCrown" or 32 characters as a hex string like "9332b7abf19b86ff48156d88c687def6".
        Your keys can be obtained from the cloud. Either do this [manually](tools/README.md), or use the [cloud library](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-cloud).
        
        
        ### `loadSettingsFromFile(path: string)`
        As an alternative to using setSettings, you can load it from a json file. The path is relative to the script being executed. An example of this json file is:
        ```
        {
         "admin":  "adminKeyForCrown",
         "member": "memberKeyForHome",
         "basic":  "basicKeyForOther",
         "serviceDataKey":  "MyServiceDataKey",
         "localizationKey":  "aLocalizationKey",
         "meshApplicationKey":  "MyGoodMeshAppKey",
         "meshNetworkKey":  "MyGoodMeshNetKey",
        }
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Searching for Crownstones
        
        In order to do something with a Crownstone, you need to know which Crownstones there are.
        This can be done by scanning. There are basic and convenience functions to do this.
        
        ### `async getCrownstonesByScanning(scanDuration=3)`
        This will scan for scanDuration in seconds and return an array of the Crownstone it has found. This is an array of dictionaries that look like this:
        ```
        {
           "address": string,      # mac address like "f7:19:a4:ef:ea:f6"
           "setupMode": boolean,   # is this Crownstone in setup mode?
           "validated": boolean,   # if True, this Crownstone belongs to your Sphere (ie. it can be decrypted by the provided keys).
           "rssi": Float           # average of the rssi of this Crownstone. If None, there have been no valid measurements.
        }
        ```
        This array can be directly put in the 'addressesToExclude' field of the 'getNearest..' methods.
        
        
        ### `async startScanning(scanDuration=3)`
        This will start scanning for Crownstones in a background thread. The `scanDuration` denotes how long we will scan for.
        Once scanning is active, `BleTopics.advertisement` events will be triggered with the advertisements of the
        Crownstones that share our encryption keys or are in setup mode.
        
        
        ### `async stopScanning()`
        This will stop an active scan.
        
        
        ### `async getNearestCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[]) -> ScanData or None`
        This will search for the nearest Crownstone. It will return ANY Crownstone, not just the ones sharing our encryption keys.
        - rssiAtLeast, you can use this to indicate a maximum distance
        - scanDuration, the amount of time we scan (in seconds)
        - returnFirstAcceptable, if this is True, we return on the first Crownstone in the rssiAtLeast range. If it is False, we will scan for the timeout duration and return the closest one.
        - addressesToExclude, this is an array of either address strings (like "f7:19:a4:ef:ea:f6") or an array of dictionaries that each contain an address field (like what you get from "getCrownstonesByScanning").
        
        If anything was found, the ScanData will be returned. [This datatype is defined here.](#ScanData)
        
        
        ### `async getNearestValidatedCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[]) -> ScanData or None`
        Same as getNearestCrownstone but will only search for Crownstones with the same encryption keys.
        If anything was found, the ScanData will be returned. [This datatype is defined here.](#ScanData)
        
        
        ### `async getNearestSetupCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[]) -> ScanData or None`
        Same as getNearestCrownstone but will only search for Crownstones in setup mode.
        If anything was found, the ScanData will be returned. [This datatype is defined here.](#ScanData)
        
        
        
        ## Connecting
        
        Most commands from the [control](#control-module) and [state](#state-module) modules will require you to connect to a Crownstone before sending the command.
        
        ### `async connect(address: string)`
        This will connect to the Crownstone with the provided MAC address. You get get this address by scanning or getting the nearest Crownstone.
        
        
        ### `async disconnect()`
        This will disconnect from the Crownstone.
        
        
        
        ## Operation mode
        
        A fresh Crownstone starts in operation mode "setup". In this mode, it has limited functionality and does not belong to anyone. You can claim it by performing a setup, which is usually done with the smartphone app, as that also registers it at the cloud.
        
        ### `async def getMode(self, address, scanDuration=3) -> CrownstoneOperationMode`
        This will scan until it has received an advertisement from the Crownstone with the specified address. Once it has received an advertisement, it knows the mode.
        We will return once we know.
        
        It can raise a CrownstoneBleException with the following types:
        - `BleError.NO_SCANS_RECEIVED` We have not received any scans from this Crownstone, and can't say anything about it's state.
        
        
        ### `async def waitForMode(self, address, requiredMode: CrownstoneOperationMode, scanDuration=3) -> CrownstoneOperationMode`
        This will wait until it has received an advertisement from the Crownstone with the specified address. Once it has received an advertisement, it knows the mode. We will
        scan for the scanDuration amount of seconds or until the Crownstone is in the required mode.
        
        It can raise a CrownstoneBleException with the following types:
        - `BleError.NO_SCANS_RECEIVED`
            We have not received any scans from this Crownstone, and can't say anything about it's state.
        - `BleError.DIFFERENT_MODE_THAN_REQUIRED`
            During the `scanDuration` seconds of scanning, the Crownstone was not in the required mode.
        
        
        ### `async setupCrownstone(address: string, sphereId: int, crownstoneId: int, meshDeviceKey: string, ibeaconUUID: string, ibeaconMajor: uint16, ibeaconMinor: uint16)`
        New Crownstones are in setup mode. In this mode they are open to receiving encryption keys. This method facilitates this process. No manual connection is required.
        - address is the MAC address.
        - sphereId is a uint8 id for this Crownstone's sphere.
        - crownstoneId is a uint8 id for this Crownstone.
        - meshDeviceKey is a 16 character string.
        - ibeaconUUID is a string like "d8b094e7-569c-4bc6-8637-e11ce4221c18".
        - ibeaconMajor is a number between 0 and 65535.
        - ibeaconMinor is a number between 0 and 65535.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        # Control module
        
        The modules contain groups of methods. You can access them like this:
        ```python
        import asyncio
        from crownstone_ble import CrownstoneBle
        
        # initialize the Bluetooth Core
        ble = CrownstoneBle()
        
        async def example():
            # set the switch stat eusing the control module
            await ble.connect(address) # address is a mac address (or handle on OSX)
            await ble.control.setSwitch(0)
            await ble.disconnect()
        
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(example())
        ```
        
        
        Methods:
        
        ### `async setSwitch(switchVal: int)`
        You can switch the Crownstone. 0 for off, 100 for on, between 0 and 100 to dim. There are also special values to be found in `SwitchValSpecial`. If you want to dim, make sure dimming is enabled. You can enable this using the `allowDimming()` method.
        
        ### `async commandFactoryReset()`
        Assuming you have the encryption keys, you can use this method to put the Crownstone back into setup mode.
        
        ### `async allowDimming(allow: bool)`
        Enable or disable dimming on this Crownstone. Required if you want to dim with `setSwitch()`.
        
        ### `async disconnect()`
        Tell the Crownstone to disconnect from you. This can help if your Bluetooth stack does not reliably disconnect.
        
        ### `async lockSwitch(lock: bool)`
        Lock the switch. If locked, its switch state cannot be changed.
        
        ### `async reset()`
        Restart the Crownstone.
        
        
        
        # State module
        
        This is used to get state variables from the Crownstone. [https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/blob/master/docs/PROTOCOL.md#state-packet-1]
        
        The modules contain groups of methods. You can access them like this:
        ```python
        import asyncio
        from crownstone_ble import CrownstoneBle
        
        # initialize the Bluetooth Core
        ble = CrownstoneBle()
        
        async def example():
            # set the switch state using the control module
            await ble.connect(address)
            switchstate = await ble.state.getSwitchState()
            await ble.disconnect()
        
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(example())
        ```
        
        
        ### `async getSwitchState()`
        Get the switch state as `SwitchState` class.
        
        ### `async getTime()`
        Get the time on the Crownstone as a timestamp since epoch in seconds. This has been corrected for location.
        
        
        
        # Event bus
        
        ## API
        
        ### `once(TopicName: string, functionPointer)`
        This will subscribe for a single event. After this event, the listener will be removed automatically. It still returns a unsubscriptionId if you want to cleanup before the event occurs.
        
        ### `subscribe(TopicName: string, functionPointer)`
        Returns a subscription ID that can be used to unsubscribe again with the unsubscribe method
        
        ### `unsubscribe(subscriptionId: number)`
        This will stop the invocation of the function you provided in the subscribe method, unsubscribing you from the event.
        
        
        ## Events
        These events are available for the BLE part of this lib:
        
        ### `BleTopics.newDataAvailable`
        This is a topic to which events are posted which are unique. The same message will be repeated on the advertisement and the rawAdvertisement packets.
        
        ### `BleTopics.rawAdvertisement`
        This topic will broadcast all incoming Crownstone scans, including those that do not belong to your sphere (ie. can't be decrypted with your keys).
        
        ### `BleTopics.advertisement`
        This topic will broadcast all incoming Crownstone scans which belong to your sphere (ie. which can be decrypted with your keys).
        
        
        ### Data format
        All these events contain the same data format:
        
        ```python
        class ScanData:
        
            def __init__(self):
                self.address       = None    # this is the handle of the device that broadcast the advertisement. This is usually a MAC address, but on OSX it is a handle.
                self.rssi          = None    # the signal strength indicator
                self.name          = None    # name of the device
                self.operationMode = None    # CrownstoneOperationMode enum (SETUP, NORMAL, DFU, UNKNOWN)
                self.serviceUUID   = None    # the UUID of the scanned service
                self.deviceType    = None    # type of Crownstone
                self.payload       = None    # See below.
                self.validated     = None    # Whether your provided keys could decrypt this advertisement
        ```
        These fields are always filled. The payload will differ depending on what sort of data is advertised. [You can see all possible types here.](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/tree/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers)
        These payloads all have a `type` field [which is defined here.](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/elements/AdvTypes.py)
        Payloads come in these flavours:
        
        - [CROWNSTONE_STATE](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvCrownstoneState.py)
        - [CROWNSTONE_ERROR](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvErrorPacket.py)
        - [EXTERNAL_STATE](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvExternalCrownstoneState.py)
        - [EXTERNAL_ERROR](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvExternalErrorPacket.py)
        - [ALTERNATIVE_STATE](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvAlternativeState.py)
        - [HUB_STATE](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvHubState.py)
        - [MICROAPP_DATA](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvMicroappData.py)
        - [SETUP_STATE](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core/blob/master/crownstone_core/packets/serviceDataParsers/containers/AdvCrownstoneSetupState.py)
        
        
        
        ## Usage
        You can obtain the eventBus directly from the lib:
        ```python
        from crownstone_ble import BleEventBus, BleTopics
        
        # simple example function to print the data you receive
        def showNewData(data):
        	print("received new data: ", data)
        
        # Set up event listeners
        subscriptionId = BleEventBus.subscribe(BleTopics.newDataAvailable, showNewData)
        
        # unsubscribe again
        BleEventBus.unsubscribe(subscriptionId)
        ```
        
        
        # Common issues
        
        ### Bluetooth on Linux
        
        If bluetooth seems stuck, try:
        ```
        sudo rfkill block bluetooth
        sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
        ```
