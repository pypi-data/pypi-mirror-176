Name	Label	Enumeration	Parent property	Definitional reference	Definition
positive	Positive	0	Cell phenotype criterion polarity	CLO:0054406	For a binary/trinary cell phenotype criterion, the presence or most-abundance indicator.
negative	Negative	1	Cell phenotype criterion polarity		For a binary/trinary cell phenotype criterion, the absence or least-abundance indicator.
low	Low	2	Cell phenotype criterion polarity		For a trinary cell phenotype criterion, the intermediate value.
immunohistochemistry	Immunohistochemistry	0	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0001986	An immunostaining assay to detect and potentially localize antigens within the cells of a tissue section. 
immunofluorescence	Immunofluorescence	1	Mechanism of target marking	ECO:0000007	A marking system in which the antibody is conjugated to a fluorophore, the latter rendered observable by active imaging, the process consisting of excitation of the specimen and observation of emission at specific wavelengths.
multiplexed_immunohistochemistry	Multiplexed immunohistochemistry	2	Mechanism of target marking		Immunohistochemistry in which a special procedure is used to allow simultaneous or sequential staining on the same specimen.
multiplexed_immunofluorescence	Multiplexed immunofluorescence	3	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0003091	Immunofluorescence in which a special procedure is used to allow simultaneous or sequential staining on the same specimen.
in_situ_hybridization	In situ hybridization	4	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0001686	An assay that localizes a specific DNA or RNA sequence within a portion or section of tissue using artificially induced nucleic hybridization.
fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization	Fluorescence in situ hybridization	5	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0003094	An in-situ hybridization assay in which fluorescently labeled molecules are used to localize specific DNA or RNA sequences.
flow_cytometry	Flow cytometry	6	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0000916	A cytometry assay in which an input cell population is put in solution, is passed by a laser, and optical sensors are used to detect scattering of the laser light and/or fluorescence of specific markers to count and characterize the particles in solution.
imaging_mass_cytometry	Imaging mass cytometry	7	Mechanism of target marking	OBI:0003096	A cytometry time of flight assay in which molecules of interest on or in cells are imaged through a system in which samples are labeled with multiple different rare-earth tagged antibodies. The sample is then ablated with a laser and the labeled material is detected by cytometry time of flight mass spectrometry.
esri_shapefile_shp	ESRI Shapefile SHP	0	Shape specification file format		ESRI Shapefile .shp portion, feature geometry. Often the contents should be a single point or a single closed polygon.
portable_network_graphics_mask	Portable network graphics mask	1	Shape specification file format	NCIT:C85437	A Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file with 2-bit depth (monochrome). The 1 value indicates membership in the shape structure, and the 0 value indicates non-membership.
