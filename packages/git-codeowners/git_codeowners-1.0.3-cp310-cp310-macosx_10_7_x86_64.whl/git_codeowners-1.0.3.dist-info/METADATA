# git-codeowners

**A git subcommand to query and validate CODEOWNERS.**

List owners of files based on the [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) of the current repository.

```
> git codeowners src/main.rs
src/main.rs                    @weyland
```

```
> git codeowners `git ls-files`
.gitignore                     (unowned)
Cargo.lock                     @weyland
Cargo.toml                     @weyland
LICENSE                        (unowned)
README.md                      @weyland
src/main.rs                    @weyland
```

```
# oops, did the last commit add some unowned files?
> git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A | git codeowners
.gitignore                     (unowned)
LICENSE                        (unowned)
```

```
# I need stats about my big monorepo
> echo `git ls-files | git codeowners | grep "(unowned)"| wc -l` out of `git ls-files | git codeowners | wc -l` files in this repository do not have a corresponding CODEOWNERS entry
2 out of 6 files in this repository do not have a corresponding CODEOWNERS entry
```

## Installation

- Via pip: `pip install git-codeowners`
- Via Cargo: `cargo install git-owners`

  ```
