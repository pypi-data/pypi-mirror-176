## Name
python-pptx-templating

## Description
The goal of this library is to add templating feature to python-pptx.
By templating I mean a possibility to create new slides & slide decks based on pre-populated master slides.
It requires a certain way to name placeholders and placeholder content using mustache templating.

## Installation
```bash
pip install python-pptx-templating
```

## Usage
TODO Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
