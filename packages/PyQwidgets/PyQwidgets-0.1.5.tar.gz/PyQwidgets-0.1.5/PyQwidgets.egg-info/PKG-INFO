Hello, in this description we will briefly get acquainted with PyQwidgets.

Let's start by importing the libraries.

from PyQwidgets import *

And so we imported the library, now add an error.

from PyQwidgets import *

error = QError("Name window", "Error message")

Let's take a closer look, "error" we created a variable.
"QError" called a method that makes an error window.
"Name window" is written in double quotes,
this is the name of the error window, after "Name window" comes "Error message"
this is a message in the window that describes the error itself
