We then follow the test methodology of Section \\@ref(clustering), re-running all tests with scenarios for $N_y$ covering [0,100]. Figure \\@ref(fig:741) compare the results for discrepancy errors of the three methods. One can check visually that discrepancy errors is zero, whatever the clustering method is, when the number of clusters $N_y$ tends to $N_x$. Note also that our kernel clustering methods shows quite good inertia performance indicators. This is surprising, as our method is based on discrepancy error minimization, not inertia.

                "There esxists a vast literature on RKHS methods (cf. the list of refetences at the end of this monograph) and, in particular on kernel regressions. A good reference is the textbook \"Elements of Statistical Learning Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction\" by R.Tibshirani et al. RKHS methods in statistics and related fields are described in the textbook \"Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces in Probability and Statistics\" by C. Thomas-Agnan et al. This also studied in \"A Hilbert Space Embedding for Distributions\" by A. Smola, A. Gretton et al. A dimension reduction technique for kernel least-square models was introduced in \"Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space\" by R. Rosipal and L. Trejo. \n",
