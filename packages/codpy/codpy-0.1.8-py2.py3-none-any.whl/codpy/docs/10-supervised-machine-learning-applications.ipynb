One can check visually that this kernel method better reconstruct the original image. It would be erroneous to conclude that this reconstruction process performs better than the SART algorithm, and it is not at all our speech here. We simply illustrate here the capacity of our algorithm to recognize existing patterns: indeed, note that the first image is perfectly reconstructed, as it is part of the training set. This property emphasizes that such methods suit well to pattern recognition problems, as automated tools to support professionals diagnosis.\n"
