On  the other hand, it can capture third and forth moments of light and heavy-tailed distributions, but we can see in Figure \\@ref(fig:187) that there are some samples between two modes. \n",

For example, Scipy's optimization and root finding module[^402] allows to find LSAP using a Hungarian algorithm when the cost matrix is unbalanced. A python library Lapjv[^403] allows to find LSAP using Jonker-Volgenant algorithm[^404]. The Sinkhorn algorithm[^405],[^406] is fast heuristic for the Kantorovich problem, that allows to solve efficiently LSAP, but the matrix obtained by using the Sinkhorn algorithm is not always a permutation matrix. It was implemented for some cases in POT library[^407].\n",
