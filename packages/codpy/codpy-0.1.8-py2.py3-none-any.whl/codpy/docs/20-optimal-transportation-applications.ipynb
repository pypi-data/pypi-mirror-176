                "A more recent field of research are non-parametric models, based on neural networks, as for instance GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). There exists a number of works using GANs in finance for time series prediction, portfolio management or fraud detection, see for instance \\cite{EFO:2021} for a review. However, this approach still needs to prove its efficiency for pricing purposes.\n",
                "\n",
                "In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to non-parametric models, producing synthetic data using kernel methods. Kernel methods are explainable since we can measure the accuracy of predictions with error estimates. These estimates are based on a distance between measures, that is a natural link to optimal transport theory. This allows to reproduce any random variables based on the observation of their realizations, as well as to quantify theoretically the discretization error.\n",

The first checks that the time series forecast can be used for Monte Carlo pricing.

We compute various numerical metrics to show the convergence properties of our methods.\n",
