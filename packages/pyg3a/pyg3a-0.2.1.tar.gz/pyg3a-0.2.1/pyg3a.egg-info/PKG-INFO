# Description

A tool to convert Python files to Casio fx-CG 10/20/50 (Prizm) Add-ins

# Installation

    pip install pyg3a


# Usage

    pyg3a <file.py> -l path/to/libfxcg [--debug] [--verbose]


# How it works

1.  Project is Created:
    
    PyG3A will create a 'project' in the directory '`.pyg3a_build/<file>/`'. <br/>
    It then creates a Makefile to build the project later. <br/>
    This should only happen once.

2.  Python is Parsed:
    
    PyG3A uses the *libcst* module to parse the input python file.

3.  Imports are Checked:
    
    It iterates over the imports in the file, and checks the '`<install location>/packages`' and '`~/.local/lib/pyg3a/`' directory for .py files matching this name. <br/>
    The functions in this file are added to a list for future use.

4.  Code is Transpiled:
    
	PyG3A internally puts your whole Python file into the main() function, then transpiles to C++, placing function definitions outside the main() function (as C++ does not support nested functions)<br/>
    This takes into account the packages imported in your program for function overloads.

5.  C++ is Compiled:
    
    The C++ is compiled and linked using GNU Make. <br/>
    Execution starts from your Python file's main() function (if defined), or from your first statement. <br/>
    Any G++ output will be shown in the python output as a means of debugging. <br/>
    Using '`--verbose`' will print the commands that are being run through make.


# Notes

The function `raw_c(str)` inserts that str into the transpiled C++.

Importing replaces .s with /s, for example:

    import custom.random
    from custom.random import *
    from custom.random import a

All of these import the '`random`' module in the '`~/.local/lib/pyg3a/custom`' folder. <br/>
Variables are statically typed. <br/>
PyG3A will try and infer types, but it is recommended that you use type hints where possible. Function argument types are not inferred and must be specified.
