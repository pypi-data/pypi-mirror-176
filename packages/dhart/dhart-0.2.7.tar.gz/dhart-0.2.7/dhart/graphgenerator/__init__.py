Provides a function to generate a graph on accessible terrain
====================================================================


The Graph Generator makes it easy to get an estimation of where
a person could travel within an environment, without requiring
much input. This is very useful, as the nodes and graph
output from the graph generator can be used as input for several
of the other analysis types within DHART.
