This is a simple package to create a webserver to keep your repl online using a pinger. (such as https://up.rdsl.ga/). With the new version your console won't be spammed with useless error logs.

## Usage:

First you need to install the package by going to the shell and pasting: `pip install replit-keep-alive` in there. Wait until it is finished

Now the actual code:

--------
Recommended version to use:
```py
from replit_keep_alive import WaitressStart
WaitressStart() 
```


- Default
```py
from replit_keep_alive import start
start() #The text argument is optional. So we didn't use it here
```
- Or with custom text

```py
from replit_keep_alive import start
start("Hello world!") #The text argument is optional. 
```
--------

- Waitress version. (Without debug/development server)

```py
from replit_keep_alive import WaitressStart
WaitressStart() #The text argument is optional. So we didn't use it here. 
```

- Or the waitress version. With custom text 
```py
from replit_keep_alive import WaitressStart
WaitressStart("Hello world!") #The text argument is optional. So we didn't use it here. 
```

---------

Paste these codeblocks somewhere in your code to get it working!
