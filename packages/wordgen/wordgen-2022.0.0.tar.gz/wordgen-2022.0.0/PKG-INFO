# Word generator (for all you goddam keeb nerds 🤓)

## The story

I was using this funny site to learn Colemak DHm and slowly started realising that the site was (and still is) nowhere near as funny as I thought and came to the conclusion that Monkeytype is signifficantly more funny. Here's the problem: the site was able to generate to generate different level words, such as only using finger keys, or adding adjacent keys to the mix (so like only using `arst` `neio` for example), but Monkeytype has no such feature.

yeah anw this exists now, use it with custom mode in Monkeytype and you can get the ultimate training experience

## Configuration

You can customise the script to your heart's content on the first few lines. I did not and do not plan on adding any interactive elements at this time, if I feel brave enough I might add command line arguments through Click at a later date (or maybe in just an hour or something idk).

i forgor what i was typing about 💀
