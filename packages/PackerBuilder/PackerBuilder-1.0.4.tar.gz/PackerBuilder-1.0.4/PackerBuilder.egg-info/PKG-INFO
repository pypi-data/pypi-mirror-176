        I built this module to help automate packer builds in python code. I found it to be nearly 
        impossible to scale packer builds for a pipeline or automated environment without forking 
        the code from packer's `golang` [implementation](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer).

        ### Requirements
        
        - [Install Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads)
        
        ### Installation
        
        `pip install PackerBuilder` ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PackerBuilder/1.0.0/))
        
        
        ### Documentation
        
        [`PackerBuilder`](packerpy/builder.py): This class is extendable (as shown in 
        [`packerpy.examples.ami_builder`](./examples/ami_builder.py)) in order to allow for a custom implementation 
        of any packer builder plugin. The `PackerBuilder` will generate a json packer configuration file that can 
        be executed by the packer cli.
        
        [`PackerClient`](packerpy/client.py): This is a utility class built to interact with the packer cli.
        
        [`models`](packerpy/models.py): The `models` submodule contains objects that map to packer config blocks in the 
        `.pkr.json` file that gets generated.
