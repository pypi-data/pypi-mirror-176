.. - Model Sparsity
..    - Indexes in pandas are flexible and powerful
..    - Most mathematical optimization models have sparse index sets
..    - Leverage sparse indexes to avoid creating unnecessary variables
..    - Pandas' aggregation operations efficiently transform between the index sets in your model
..    - See the knapsack and network flow examples for discussion on data filtering and sparsity
