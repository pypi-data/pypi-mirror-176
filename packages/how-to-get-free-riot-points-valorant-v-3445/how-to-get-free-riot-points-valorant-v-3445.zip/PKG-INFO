Valorant releases a Battle pass every new Act. And while there is no guarantee which guns will be in the battle pass, it always gives you around 9 to 12 gun skins. These skins come in sets of 3. So there is a good chance you will get a Spectre skin. But the catch of a battle pass is just buying the battle pass wonâ€™t get you the Spectre skin. You will have to grind to earn the XP needed to reach the tier where you can unlock the Spectre skin. So to sum it up.
