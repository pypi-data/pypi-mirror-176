Maintaining many machine learning experiments requires much manual effort. This lightweight tool helps you currently run a **LOT** of experiments with simple commands and configurations. You can easily aggregate custom metrics for each experiment with a single line of code.

## Install
```
$ pip install mlrunner
```
## Usage
Download and edit [params.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simtony/mlrunner/main/params.yaml), then simply
```
$ run
```
When all experiments finish, start a jupyter notebook and analyze results using `examine.Examiner`.

See the [github repo](https://github.com/simtony/mlrunner) for example use cases.
