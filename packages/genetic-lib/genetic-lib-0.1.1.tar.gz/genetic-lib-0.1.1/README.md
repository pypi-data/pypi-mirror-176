# AI Project 

Linear and Logistic Regression both mostly use Gradient Descent as their optimization algorithm


This project makes use of **Genetic Algorithm**  instead to optimize the Weights and Biases

Genetic Algorithm follows:-

1. Initialization
2. Selection 
3. Crossover 
4. Mutation 
5. Termination
