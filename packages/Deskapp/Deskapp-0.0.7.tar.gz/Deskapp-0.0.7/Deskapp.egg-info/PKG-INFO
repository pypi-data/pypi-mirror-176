### TODO
    [x] Freshen up the examples folder, do a new example based on the login page where clicking somewhere spawns further pages, and destroys spawned pages.

    [ ] Use the Pop Up warnings in a demo and see what their viability is.


### ChangeLog
7.26.22-Ruckusist v.0.0.4: release of version 4. This version come with new, and
    significant bugs, But with new functionality. This is just a transition point
    from one stable/working version, to the next.

4.20.22-Ruckusist v0.0.4: started working version 4.

4.6.22-Ruckusist v0.0.3: added the demo_mode flag to the App Object to turn off
    the About and Fire functionality. This gives me the idea to put more demo 
    stuff there. I want to copy cmatrix, dropping snowflakes, video player, other 
    stuff.
