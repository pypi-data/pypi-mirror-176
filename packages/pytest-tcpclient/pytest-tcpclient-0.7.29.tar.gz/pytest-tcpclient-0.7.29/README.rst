This ``README`` file is not the one that you'll see on ``github`` or ``pypi``.

The ``github`` ``README`` is in ``.github/README.rst``. It is generated by the
``Makefile`` because of limitations of ``github``'s rendering of ``rst`` files.
``pypi`` uses the same file.

``GITHUB_README_TEMPLATE.rst`` is the document from which
``.github/README.rst`` is generated.
