# Chronolog

## What is Chronolog?

Chronolog is an open-source command-line application that allows its users to chronologically log information about their day (hence the name). It was initially created to eleminate the tedious task of creating and organizing documents to log events, findings, progress, and more during the workday.

## Use cases

- Logging key takeaways from meetings, key-concepts learned, and events at work. It allows one to always have an alibi during their workday.

- Anything you see fit to log!

## Installation
