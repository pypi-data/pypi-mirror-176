more test on delete
more test on logs
more test!

## Golden rules

Here is a list of golden rules.

1. 100% test coverage : test is ok <=> you can release
2. explicit is better than implicit
3. keep it stupid and simple
4. Do not reinvent the wheel
5. 80/20 usage: Do the 80%. DON'T do the 20%
6. keep a round API
7. API is security/consistency, UI is usability/ergonomy
8. security: everything is forbidden, except if it's allowed

## Stack

Do not re-invent the wheel as a golden rule. So it uses : 

* Flask
* Flask-Limiter
* Flask-Login
* Flask-Mail
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* SQLAlchemy
* jsonschema
* redis
* postgresql
* nginx, uwsgi and haproxy for prod tools (even if you can use another one)

And on develpment side :

* pytest and pytest-cov
* black
* pylint
* freezegun

### Why not Flask-restful?

It's not maintenaind anymore : https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/issues/883

And it turns out that flask handle pretty well json requests and response out-of-the-box. Furthermore, a rest framework adds some opiniated choices that can be imcompatible with other well known flask plugin. So let's try with raw flask. As now, the only code we had to add is the exception handler.


## Target archi 

* Add/modify document
  * update DB
  * build document JSON
  * update Redis with the serialized document
* get document -> get in redis
* get list of document -> get ids in PG, values in redis
