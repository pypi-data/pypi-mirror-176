Short for Python Data Structures, Pydast is a powerful python module providing a bunch of efficient and method-rich distribution of Data Structures not already pre-built into python.
Functionalities to retrieve abstract data are also provided in order to make this much more flexible for all purpose needs.
In some cases, abstraction is kept low in order to provide maximal Control
