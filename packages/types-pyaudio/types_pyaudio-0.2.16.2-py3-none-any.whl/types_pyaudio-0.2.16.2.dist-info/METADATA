## Typing stubs for pyaudio

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pyaudio` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `pyaudio`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyaudio. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `1733c460582e6bf83a3592e5b24f9fd0e3fdeddc`.
