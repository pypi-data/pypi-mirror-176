A Cross-Platform Python implementation of 'top' command using Psutil.

## What top Does

Top is able to get most of the top information with the
restrictions that come with running it at the program level.
Different statistics are shown based on
the operating system that this project is run on.
top works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

## How to Get Started With top

You can get started with top by cloning the repository and running this command:

``` python src/top.py ```

in the base directory.
Like the top command, this will run forever.
You can exit out of the program by entering a keyboard
interrupt or exiting your terminal altogether.
You can also specify the amount of times you want the program
to run by giving a second integer input.
For example, you can run the program for one iteration
by writing the command

```python src/top.py 1```.

## Running GatorGrade Checks

This repository is able to be automatically assessed using GatorGrade.
These checks can be run from the repository's base directory by running the command

```gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml```

in the base directory if you have GatorGrade installed.
If you do not have GatorGrade installed yet on your local machine,
you can install it by using the command

```pip install gatorgrade```.

These checks ensure that files are formatted correctly
with proficient levels of polish and also run without crashing.
GatorGrade checks are  useful both during and after development.
