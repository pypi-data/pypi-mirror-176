        About
        =====
        
        EggLib is a Python library, largely implemented in C++, for evolutionary
        genetics and genomics. Main features are sequence data management,
        sequence polymorphism analysis, and coalescent simulations. EggLib is a
        flexible Python module with a performant underlying C++ library and
        allows fast and intuitive development of Python programs and scripts.

        Installation
        ============
        
        EggLib is available on pip. For more information on installing EggLib or
        downloading source code please refer to the installation section of the
        documentation: `<https://egglib.org/install.html>`_.
        
        Cloning
        =======
        
        You can clone the whole package using::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/demita/egglib.git
        
        For example, this lets you access to the current version on development::
        
            cd egglib
            git checkout dev
        
        Building local documentation
        ============================
        
        To generate the documentation locally, you should clone the repository,
        and run this (assuming the package has been installed)::
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
            python setup.py build_pdf
        
        The first command generates the html documentation (available in the
        ``doc/build/html`` directory) and the second generates three pdf
        documents containing the main sections of the documentation (in the
        ``doc/build/latex`` directory).
        
        To generate documentation, one needs:
        
        * A LaTex processor, containing the following packages: anyfontsize,
          amsmath, fncychap, capt-of, needspace, framed, upquote, wrapfig (and
          possibly others).
        * ``python3-sphinx``
        * ``python3-svgwrite``
        * ``latexmk``
