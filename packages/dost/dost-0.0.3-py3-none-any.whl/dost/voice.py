"""
Voice Module for dost.This module contains all the functions related to voice recognition and text to speech.

Examples:
    >>> from dost import voice
    >>> voice.text_to_speech(audio="Hello World")
    

This module contains the following functions:
        
- `speech_to_text()`: Converts speech to text.
- `text_to_speech(audio, show, rate)`: Converts text to speech.
