# Assumes that the SDE-ness is interpretable by finding AbstractBrownianPath.
# In principle a user could re-create terms, controls, etc. without going via this,
# though. So this is a bit imperfect.
#
# Fortunately, at time of writing this is used for two things:
# - solver.error_order
# - error checking
# The former can be overridden by `PIDController(error_order=...)` and the latter is
# really just to catch common errors.
# That is, for the power user who implements enough to bypass this check -- probably
# they know what they're doing and can handle both of these cases appropriately.
