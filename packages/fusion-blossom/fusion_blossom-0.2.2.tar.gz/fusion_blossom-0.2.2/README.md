# Fusion Blossom
A fast Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) solver for Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

Please see [our tutorial for a quick explanation and some Python demos](https://tutorial.fusionblossom.com).

## Key Features

- **Correctness**: This is an exact MWPM solver, verified against the [Blossom V library](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html) with millions of randomized test cases .
- **Linear Complexity**: The decoding time is roughly $O(N)$ given small physical error rate, proportional to the number of defect vertices $N$.
- **Parallelism**: A single MWPM decoding problem can be partitioned and solved in parallel, then *fused* together to find an **exact** global MWPM solution.
- **Simple Interface**: The graph problem is abstracted and easy-to-use for QEC applications.

## Benchmark Highlights

- In phenomenological noise model with **$p$ = 0.005**, code distance **$d$ = 21**, planar code with $d(d-1)$ = 420 $Z$ stabilizers, 100000 measurement rounds
  - single-thread: **2.4us per defect vertex** or 29us per measurement round
  - 64-threads: 58ns per defect vertex or **0.7us per measurement round**

## Background and Key Ideas

MWPM decoders are widely known for its high accuracy [[1]](#fowler2012topological) and several optimizations that further improves its accuracy [[2]](#criger2018multi). However, there weren't many publications that improve the speed of the MWPM decoder over the past 10 years. Fowler implemented an $O(N)$ asymptotic complexity MWPM decoder in [[3]](#fowler2012towards) and proposed an $O(1)$ complexity parallel MWPM decoder in [[4]](#fowler2013minimum), but none of these are publicly available to our best knowledge. Higgott implemented a fast but approximate MWPM decoder (namely "local matching") with roughly $O(N)$ complexity in [[5]](#higgott2022pymatching). With recent experiments of successful QEC on real hardware, it's time for a fast and accurate MWPM decoder to become available to the community.

Our idea comes from our study on the Union-Find (UF) decoder [[6]](#delfosse2021almost). UF decoder is a fast decoder with $O(N)$ worst-case time complexity, at the cost of being less accurate compared to the MWPM decoder. Inspired by the Fowler's diagram [[3]](#fowler2012towards), we found a relationship between the UF decoder [[7]](#wu2022interpretation). This [nice animation](https://us.wuyue98.cn/aps2022/#/3/1) (press space to trigger animation) could help people see the analogy between UF and MWPM decoders. With this interpretation, we're able to combind the strength of UF and MWPM decoders together.

- From the UF decoder, we learnt to use a sparse decoding graph representation for fast speed
- From the MWPM decoder, we learnt to find an exact minimum-weight perfect matching for high accuracy

We shall note that Oscar Higgott and Craig Gidney independently reach the same approach of using sparse decoding graph to solve MWPM more efficiently in PyMatching V2 [[8]](#pymatchingv2). It's impressive to see that they have much better single-thread performance than fusion-blossom (about 5x-20x speedup). They use more optimizations like priority queue and single-tree strategy that appears in existing literature of blossom algorithms  (possibly some other novel techniques, looking forward to their paper!). Also, they use C++ language rather than Rust programming language. Rust enforces memory safety which adds some runtime overhead (like vector boundary check and unnecessary locks in parallel programming). We use `unsafe` Rust to improve the speed by 1.5x-3x but these features are not yet enabled in the Python library and only available when using the native Rust library. In fact, PyMatching V2's optimizations and fusion-blossom's parallel computation (fusion operation) are compatible with each other. With their impressive work, we're looking forward to another 5x-20x speed of the parallel MWPM decoder if combined together. For now, user should use PyMatching for better CPU efficiency in large-scale simulations, and use fusion-blossom library as an educational tool with [visualization tool](https://visualize.fusionblossom.com/?filename=primal_module_serial_basic_10.json) and [entry-level tutorials](https://tutorial.fusionblossom.com).

## Demo

We highly suggest you watch through several demos here to get a sense of how the algorithm works. All our demos are captured from real algorithm execution. In fact, we're showing you the visualized debugger tool we wrote for fusion blossom. The demo is a 3D website and you can control the view point as you like.

## Usage

Our code is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language for speed and memory safety, but it's hardly a easy language to learn. To make the decoder more accessible, we bind the library to Python and user can simply install the library using `pip3 install fusion-blossom`.

We have several Python demos at [the tutorial website](https://tutorial.fusionblossom.com/demo/example-qec-codes.html) . Also there is a simple example for decoder, and you can run it by cloning the project and run `python3 scripts/demo.py`.

For parallel solver, it needs user to provide a partition strategy. Please wait for our paper for a thorough description of how partition works.

## Evaluation

We use Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8375C CPU for evaluation, with 64 physical cores and 128 threads. Note that Apple m1max CPU has roughly 2x single-core decoding speed, but it has limited number of cores so we do not use data from m1max. The benchmark scripts can be found in `benchmark` folder, running in Rust native binary (not the Python package, which has fewer optimization features enabled). By default, we test phenomenological noise model with **$p$ = 0.005**, code distance **$d$ = 21**, planar code with $d(d-1)$ = 420 $Z$ stabilizers, 100000 measurement rounds.

First of all, the number of partitions will effect the speed. Intuitively, the more partitions there are, the more overhead because fusing two partitions consumes more computation than solving them as a whole. But in practice, memory access is not always at the same speed. If cache cannot hold the data, then solving big partition may consume even more time than solving small ones. We test on a single-thread decoder, and try different partition numbers. At partition number = 2000, we get roughly the minimum decoding time of 2.4us per defect vertex. This corresponds to each partition hosting 50 measurement rounds (decoding blocks of 49 * 21 * 20).

Given the optimal partition number of a single thread, we keep the partition number the same and try increasing the number of threads. Note that the partition number may not be optimal for large number of threads, but even in this case, we reach 41x speed up given 64 physical cores. The decoding time is pushed to 58ns per sydnrome or 0.7us per measurement round. This can catch up with the 1us measurement round of a superconducting circuit. Interestingly, we found that hyperthreading won't help much in this case, perhaps because this decoder is memory-bounded, meaning memory throughput is the bottleneck. Although the number of defect vertices is only a small portion, they are randomly distributed so every time a new syndrome is given, the memory is almost always cold and incur large cache miss panelty.

In order to understand the bottleneck of  parallel execution, we wrote a visualization tool to display the execution windows of base partitions and fusion operations on multiple threads. Blue blocks is the base partition and green blocks is the fusion operation. Fusion operation only scales with the size of the fusion boundary and the depth of active partitions, irrelevant to the base partition's size. We'll study different partition and fusion strategies in our paper. Below shows the parallel execution on 64 threads. Blue blocks are base partitions, each is a 49 * 21 * 20 decoding graph block. Green blocks are fusion blocks, each is a 1 * 21 * 20 decoding graph block sandwiched by two neighbor base partitions. You can click the image which jumps to this interactive visualization tool.

## Interface

#### Sparse Decoding Graph and Integer Weights

The weights in QEC decoding graph are computed by taking the log of error probability, e.g. $w_e = \log\{(1-p)/p\}$ or roughly $w_e = -\log{p}$, we can safely use integers to save weights by e.g. multiplying the weights by 1e6 and truncate to nearest integer. In this way, the truncation error $\Delta w_e = 1$ of integer weights corresponds to relative error $\Delta p /{p}=10^{-6}$ which is small enough. Suppose physical error rate $p$ is in the range of a positive `f64` variable (2.2e-308 to 1), the maximum weight is 7e7,which is well below the maximum value of a `u32` variable (4.3e9). Since weights only sum up in our algorithm (no multiplication), `u32` is large enough and accurate enough. By default we use `usize` which is platform dependent (usually 64 bits), but you can 

We use integer also for ease of migrating to FPGA implementation. In order to fit more vertices into a single FPGA, it's necessary to reduce the resource usage for each vertex. Integers are much cheaper than floating-point numbers, and also it allows flexible trade-off between resource usage and accuracy, e.g. if all weights are equal, we can simply use a 2 bit integer.

Note that other libraries of MWPM solver like [Blossom V](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-009-0002-8) also default to integer weights as well. Although one can change the macro to use floating-point weights, it's not recommended because "the code may even get stuck due to rounding errors".

## Installation

Here is an example installation on Ubuntu20.04.

```sh
# install rust compiler and package manager
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# install build dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential
```

## Tests

In order to test the correctness of our MWPM solver, we need a ground-truth MWPM solver. [Blossom V](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-009-0002-8) is widely-used in existing MWPM decoders, but according to the license we cannot embed it in this library. To run the test cases with ground truth comparison or enable the functions like `blossom_v_mwpm`, you need to download this library [at this website](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html) to a folder named `blossomV` at the root directory of this git repo.

```shell
wget -c https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software/blossom5-v2.05.src.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
cp -r blossom5-v2.05.src/* blossomV/
rm -r blossom5-v2.05.src
```
