This can help you answer questions like:

- In how many companies have I been shortlisted yet?
- What companies rejected my profile?
- In how many companies I've given tech interviews?
- In how many HR rounds I got rejected?
- How many offers do I have? *Though you won't forget this one!*

And the list goes on.
