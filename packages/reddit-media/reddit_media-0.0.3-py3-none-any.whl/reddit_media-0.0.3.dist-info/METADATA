Gets media file URLs from Reddit submissions using [Async PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/asncpraw) library and downloads it. Supports video and single or gallery images. Can be used both as standalone package and library for Python scripts.

## How to install

To use this package, you first have to [install Python 3.7 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (versions below are not supported). Then open your terminal and type following command to install the latest version of the package from PyPI repository:

```console
pip install reddit-media
```

Reddit API requires authentication for scripts that use it, so you will have to do some configuration beforehand. Specifically, it requires app Client ID and Client Secret. You can create both very easily following next steps:

- Open this page: https://reddit.com/prefs/apps
- If you are not logged in into your Reddit account, you will be prompted to do so
- You will see 'authorized applications' page
- Scroll to the very bottom and press 'create another app...' button
- Select application type 'script'
- Enter any name and redirect URL you want (you will be able to change it later)
- Press 'create app' button. You will see your new app created
- Copy Client ID just under 'personal use script' text and name of the app
- Copy Client Secret next to 'secret' field

> **Note**: For details about authenticating, check out this page: [Authenticating via OAuth](https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html)

## Using as a library

If your Python script needs to get URLs of some Reddit submission, but you don't want to do it yourself, you can use this package to do it for you. Once you installed the package, you can just import it and use as any other library:

```python
import asyncio
from redditmedia import get_reddit, get_media, MediaType

async def main():
  async with get_reddit(client_id='your-client-id', client_secret='your-client-secret') as reddit:
    subreddit = await reddit.subreddit('cute')
    async for submission in subreddit.hot(limit=10):  # First 10 submissions on r/cute
      for media in get_media(submission).media:
        if media.type in [MediaType.jpg, MediaType.png]:  # Print URL only if it's an image
          print(media.uri)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Using as standalone program

If you want to download bunch of media files from some reddit submissions of subreddit, you can do this by using this package as standalone CLI program. You can do that by entering this into your terminal:

```console
python -m redditmedia -c [CLIENT ID] [CLIENT SECRET] get [SUBMISSION IDS]
```

This will download all media files from specified submissions into `reddit-media-downloads` folder in current working directory. If you wish to change path of the folder where media should be downloaded to, you can specify it by adding `-p [PATH TO FOLDER]` option before `get` command above, or if you wish to have media files in separate folders depending on the submission they are from, you can do that by adding `-s` flag before `get` command.

For more info, enter:

```console
python -m redditmedia --help
```

## Storing credentials in a file

As you can see, both use cases require you to explicitly provide credentials, which can be security issue and generally inconvenient. Instead you can create `praw.ini` file inside your current working directory and paste this:

```ini
[redditmedia]
client_id=<Paste Client ID here>
client_secret=<Paste Client Secret here>
```

Now you can omit keyword arguments when calling `get_reddit` and credentials will be automatically picked up from the file:

```python
from redditmedia import get_reddit
reddit = get_reddit()
```

And when using CLI tool, omit `-c` option:

```console
python -m redditmedia get [IDS OF SUBMISSIONS SEPARATED WITH SPACE]
```

> **Note**: You can do more things using this file, which is outside of the topic of this page. For details about `praw.ini` file, check out documentation: [praw.ini Files](https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html)
