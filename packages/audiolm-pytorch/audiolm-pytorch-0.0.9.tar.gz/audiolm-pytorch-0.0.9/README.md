## AudioLM - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/">AudioLM</a>, a Language Modeling Approach to Audio Generation out of Google Research, in Pytorch

## Install

```bash
$ pip install audiolm-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch.audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream, AudioLM, FineTransformer, FineTransformerWrapper

soundstream = SoundStream(
    codebook_size = 1024,
    rq_num_quantizers = 8,
)

transformer = FineTransformer(
    num_coarse_quantizers = 3,
    num_fine_quantizers = 5,
    codebook_size = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6
)

train_wrapper = FineTransformerWrapper(
    soundstream = soundstream,
    transformer = transformer
).cuda()

raw_waveform = torch.randn(1, 320 * 512).cuda()

loss = train_wrapper(
    raw_wave = raw_waveform,
    return_loss = True
)

loss.backward()
```

- <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for their amazing accelerate and transformers libraries

- <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">MetaAI</a> for <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq">Fairseq</a> and the liberal license

- <a href="https://github.com/eonglints">@eonglints</a> for offering his professional advice and expertise

## Todo

- [x] complete CoarseTransformer
- [x] use fairseq vq-wav2vec for embeddings
- [x] add conditioning
- [x] add classifier free guidance

- [ ] incorporate ability to use hubert intermediate features as semantic tokens, recommended by <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch/discussions/13">eonglints</a>
- [ ] complete full training code for soundstream, taking care of discriminator training
- [ ] figure out how to do the normalization across each dimension mentioned in the paper, but ignore it for v1 of the framework
- [ ] complete sampling code for both Coarse and Fine Transformers, which will be tricky
- [ ] accommodate variable lengthed audio, bring in eos token
- [ ] full transformer training code for all three transformers
- [ ] make sure full inference with or without prompting works on the `AudioLM` class
- [ ] offer option to weight tie coarse, fine, and semantic embeddings across the 3 hierarchical transformers
- [ ] DRY a little at the end
- [ ] figure out how to suppress logging in fairseq
- [ ] test with speech synthesis for starters
- [ ] abstract out conditioning + classifier free guidance into external module or potentially a package
