# argcmd - a super-clean, super-simple Class-based API for git-like command line arguments

## Why

I got sick of implementing this multiple times, and other people asked me how to do it too.

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or later.

## Installation

Download the `*.whl` file from under `https://github.com/lee-b/argcmd/Releases`, and install
it with `pip install`. `pip` remote install, and `poetry` instructions to follow.

## Usage

See `src/argcmd/__main__.py` for an example.  You can run this example as `argcmd-test` after
installation (`argcmd-test` will go away when proper unit tests are added instead).

## License

GNU Aferro General Public License v3.0.  See included LICENSE.TXT file for details.


## Contacts

Raise a ticket at github.com/lee-b/argcmd/issues, or email me at `leebraid@gmail.com` _if (and only if)_
a ticket isn't appropriate.
