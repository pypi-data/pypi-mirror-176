[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/skypilot/badge/?version=latest)](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

SkyPilot is a framework for easily running machine learning workloads<sup>[1]</sup> on any cloud. 

Use the clouds **easily** and **cost effectively**, without needing cloud infra expertise.

_Ease of use_
* **Run existing projects on the cloud** with zero code changes
* Use a **unified interface** to run on any cloud, without vendor lock-in (currently AWS, Azure, GCP)
* **Queue jobs** on one or multiple clusters
* **Automatic failover** to find scarce resources (GPUs) across regions and clouds
* **Use datasets on the cloud** like you would on a local file system 

_Cost saving_
* Run jobs on **spot instances** with **automatic recovery** from preemptions
* Hands-free cluster management: **automatically stopping idle clusters**
* One-click use of **TPUs**, for high-performance, cost-effective training
* Automatically benchmark and find the cheapest hardware for your job

## Getting Started
You can find our documentation [here](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [Installation](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Quickstart](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/quickstart.html)
- [CLI reference](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cli.html)

## Example SkyPilot Task

A SkyPilot task specifies: resource requirements, data to be synced, setup commands, and the task commands. 

Once written in this [**unified interface**](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/yaml-spec.html) (YAML or Python API), the task can be launched on any available cloud. 

Example:

```yaml
# my_task.yaml
resources:
  # 1x NVIDIA V100 GPU
  accelerators: V100:1

# Number of VMs to launch in the cluster
num_nodes: 1

# Working directory (optional) containing the project codebase.
# Its contents are synced to ~/sky_workdir/ on the cluster.
workdir: ~/torch_examples

# Commands to be run before executing the job
# Typical use: pip install -r requirements.txt, git clone, etc.
setup: |
  pip install torch torchvision

# Commands to run as a job
# Typical use: make use of resources, such as running training.
run: |
  cd mnist
  python main.py --epochs 1
```

Prepare the workdir by cloning locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/examples.git ~/torch_examples
```

Launch with `sky launch`:
```bash
sky launch my_task.yaml
```
SkyPilot will perform multiple actions for you:
1. Find the lowest priced VM instance type across different clouds
2. Provision the VM
3. Copy the local contents of `workdir` to the VM
4. Run the task's `setup` commands to prepare the VM for running the task 
5. Run the task's `run` commands

See [**`examples`**](./examples) for more YAMLs that run popular ML frameworks on the cloud with one command (PyTorch/Distributed PyTorch, TensorFlow/Distributed TensorFlow, HuggingFace, JAX, Flax, Docker).  

Besides YAML, SkyPilot offers a corresponding [**Python API**](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/blob/master/sky/core.py) for programmatic use.
