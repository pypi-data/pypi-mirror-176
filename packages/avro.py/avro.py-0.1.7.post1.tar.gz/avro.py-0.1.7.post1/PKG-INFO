## Overview

**avro.py**, whilst being a Python package, provides a text parser that converts English text written in Roman script to its phonetic equivalent of Bengali. It implements the **Avro Phonetic Dictionary Search Library** by [Mehdi Hasan Khan](https://github.com/mugli).

The original project [pyAvroPhonetic](https://github.com/kaustavdm/pyAvroPhonetic) is based on Python 2 and can only work on versions up to **Python 2.7**. It is noteworthy that Python 2 has officially been deprecated by the original maintainers and its usage is being discouraged overall. <br>

## Inspirations

This package is inspired from **Rifat Nabi's jsAvroPhonetic** library and derives from **Kaustav Das Modak's pyAvroPhonetic.**

<br>

## Installation

Installing avro.py in your project is pretty straightforward. Run the command mentioned below (requires **Python 3.8 or higher**):

```bash
# install / upgrade
$ pip install avro.py
```

<br>

## Usage Guide
As of now, you can easily use the package by importing the module and calling the primary `parse` function.

```python
import avro

parsed_text = avro.parse('ami banglay gan gai.')
print(parsed_text)

# আমি বাংলায় গান গাই।
```

Also, you can reverse unicode Bengali to English as well (new)!

```python
import avro

reversed_text = avro.reverse('আমার সোনার বাংলা।')
print(reversed_text)

# amar sonar bangla.
```

Other use cases include [your terminal](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py-cli), literally!

**Additional Developer Notes**

The coding style for this project embraces readability and consistency over traditional styling methods. To start off, [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) has been used as the primary linting tool. The unit tests are done using the [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) framework.

```bash
# Installing the required developer toolchain.
$ python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# Running pytest.
$ python3 -m pytest --verbose

# The results should appear onwards.
# The --verbose / -v flag is used to show all the test results in detail.
```

### We're looking for bug hunters!

If you come across any kind of bug or wanna request a feature, please let us know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/issues). We do need more ideas to keep the project alive and running, don't we? :P
