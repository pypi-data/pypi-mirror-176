echofilter
==========

Echofilter is an application for segmenting an echogram. It takes as its
input an Echoview_ .EV file, and produces as its output several lines and
regions:

-  turbulence (entrained air) line

-  bottom (seafloor) line

-  surface line

-  nearfield line

-  passive data regions

-  \*bad data regions for entirely removed periods of time, in the form
   of boxes covering the entire vertical depth

-  \*bad data regions for localised anomalies, in the form of polygonal
   contour patches

Echofilter uses a machine learning model to complete this task.
The machine learning model was trained on upfacing stationary and downfacing
mobile data provided by Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE).

Full documentation can be viewed `here <https://deepsenseca.github.io/echofilter/>`__.


Usage
-----

After installing, the model can be applied at the command prompt with:

.. code:: bash

    echofilter PATH PATH2 ...

Any number of paths can be specified. Each path can either be a path to
a single csv file to process (exported using the Echoview_ application),
or a directory containing csv files. If a directory is given, all csv files
within nested subfolders of the directory will be processed.

All optional parameters can be seen by running ``echofilter`` with the help
argument.

.. code:: bash

    echofilter -h


Installation
------------

The package can be installed using pip as follows:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/DeepSenseCA/echofilter


.. _Echoview: https://www.echoview.com/
