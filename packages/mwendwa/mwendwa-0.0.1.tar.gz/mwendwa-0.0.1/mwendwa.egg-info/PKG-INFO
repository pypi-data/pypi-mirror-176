In this Python Package, i have defined 4 functions namely: 
1.add-This function returns the sum of two intergers
2.sub -This function returns the difference  of two intergers 
3. mul -This function returns the product  of two intergers
4. divide -This function returns the quotient of two intergers

The above functions need to been  as defined otherwise one gonna an error when trying to use any of the above  functions 



note: 
Additionly the 4 modules are Together packed in one root folder named Felo 
users need to  import package Felo first to their working directory 
i.e 

import Felo as F 

once This is satisfield and before using any of the listed functions, 
a user needs to import each individual function
i.e 

from Felo import add as d 
from Felo import sub as s
from Felo import mul as m
from Felo import devide as de


Again,when this is satisfield,one   can now go ahead and use the function accordingly for example
using  the function add to add two interger numbers  and store the result of this addition in my_result



my_result=add(2, 5)
my_result


upon successfull import of the
